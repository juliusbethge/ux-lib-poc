Just like Shadcn, this is not a component library. Instead it is a collection of components that you can use to build your own component library. These components are designed to be accessible and customizable, so you can easily integrate them into your projects.

Each component in this library is built to solve specific problems that most developers face while building web applications (such as asynchronous actions, form validation, etc.).

<CodePreview demo="tabs/basic" />

If there are any components that you would like to see added to this library, please feel free to open an issue on the <a href={GITHUB_REPO_URL}>GitHub repository</a>.
