import CliCommandCode from "@/components/markdown/cli-command-code/cli-command-code.astro"
import { SERVER_URL } from "@/data/env"

It doesn't matter what framework or package manager you are using. Installing components is as simple as running the `shadcn add` command followed by the URL to the component you want to install. This URL will always be formatted as <code>{SERVER_URL}/r/\<component-name\>.json</code>.

The entire install process is handled by the `shadcn` CLI tool and works identically to how you would install any other Shadcn component.

## Example

<CliCommandCode
  action="run"
  command={`shadcn@latest add ${SERVER_URL}/r/action-button.json`}
/>
